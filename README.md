# 🏷️Dodue: a minimalistic to-do list app

Dodue simplifies your task management by providing a clean, minimalistic experience, just like using post-its. Your tasks are organised by cards, providing a clear view of all your different projects, which is especially helpful for busy students with many things to do (like me!). Dodue brings simplicity and clarity back to modern multitaskers, like how task management should be.

- 🧘clean, minimalistic UI
- ✨extremely simple to use
- 🤹organise different projects easily

*Note: The app requires cross origin cookies which do not work on Safari unless the setting "allow cross site tracking" is enabled.*

The app is hosted at: [https://dodue.netlify.app/](https://dodue.netlify.app/)
